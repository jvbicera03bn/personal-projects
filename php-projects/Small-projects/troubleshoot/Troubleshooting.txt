1. Authentication Error - Could not simulate
 > tried simulating this error but with no luck so i tried searching it in the internet and as it turns out you can only encounter this problem if
you are trying to connect to a older version of msqlm, ver 5.below to be exact and this is because they use different kind of password format, I
assume they changed it because of security reasons

2.Authorization Error - 
 > you can encounter this error when you dont have the right password in the 
sql connection in your php code for you to fix this is have it enter the right password of your database

3.Network Error -
 > you can encounter this error in 2 occurence, first is when you didnt include the hostname or not entered 
it right and 2nd is when you forgot to put the port or didnt put the right port of your database for you to fix this errors is you must 
double check the parameters you entered in the sql connection.
